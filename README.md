# neural-network

## Simple Neural Network in C++

This project implements a basic artificial neural network framework in C++. It provides the essential building blocks for creating and training neural networks.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
   - A basic understanding of C++ and linear algebra

2. **Compiling:**

   - The project consists of multiple source files (e.g., `Neuron.cpp`, `Layer.cpp`, `Network.cpp`). You can compile them using a command like:
     ```bash
     g++ -o neural_network *.cpp [MATH_LIBRARY_FLAGS]
     ```
     Replace `[MATH_LIBRARY_FLAGS]` with any necessary flags for your chosen math library (if used for the `IMath` interface).

3. **Running:**
   - The compiled executable (`neural_network`) can be used to create and train a simple network. The specific usage might involve command-line arguments or configuration files depending on the implementation. Refer to the code comments or additional documentation for details.

**Project Structure:**

- **Neuron.cpp/h:** Implements the `Neuron` class, representing a fundamental unit in the network.
- **Layer.cpp/h:** Implements the `Layer` class, which holds a collection of interconnected neurons.
- **Network.cpp/h:** Implements the `Network` class, which manages multiple layers and performs training.
- **IMath.h (optional):** Defines an interface for basic mathematical operations used by the network. You might need to implement this interface based on your chosen math library.
- **[Other files] (optional):** Depending on the project's scope, there might be additional files for utility functions, data loading/preprocessing, visualization, etc.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```c++
#include "Network.h"

int main() {
  // Create a simple network with 2 input neurons, 3 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron
  Network network(2, 3, 1);

  // Train the network on a sample dataset (replace with your training data and logic)
  std::vector<double> inputs = {0.1, 0.2};
  std::vector<double> targets = {0.3};
  network.Train(inputs, targets);

  // Use the trained network for prediction
  std::vector<double> new_inputs = {0.4, 0.5};
  double prediction = network.Predict(new_inputs);
  std::cout << "Prediction: " << prediction << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Further Development:**

This is a basic framework. You can extend it by:

- Implementing different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh)
- Adding support for more complex network architectures (e.g., convolutional layers)
- Incorporating different learning algorithms (e.g., momentum, Adam)
- Including data loading and preprocessing functionalities
- Creating visualization tools to monitor training progress
